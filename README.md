# Recursion
The programming assignment will provide an exercise in using recursion.  There are two 
problems which need to be solved.  The first asks for a recursive function to calculate the 
Catalan number.  This problem will also require the student to utilize command line arguments 
for their program.  The second exercise is a path-finding problem in two-dimensional space.  
The second problem will require the student to have good overall factoring and class design.  
This will be a part of the final grade. 
 
This assignment will also require the student to use Linux to build and run their applications as 
we will test these programs solely on the Linux Lab systems. 
 
Problem 1:  The good Mr. Catalan. 
 
The Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in many counting 
problems.  They are named after the mathematician Eugene Charles Catalan 
and are defined by the 
following recursive formula: 
 
 a program called Catalan which takes one argument on the command line and calls a 
recursive function which computes the nth Catalan number.  The program then prints out the 
result to std::out. 
 

 
 
 
Problem 2:  “The Greedy Robot” or “Lost in the Supermarket” 
 
A robot is positioned on an integral point in a two-dimensional coordinate grid (xr, yr).  There is 
a treasure that has been placed at a point in the same grid at (xt, yt).  All x’s and y’s will be 
integral values.  The robot can move up (North), down (South), left (West), or right (East).  
Commands can be given to the robot to move one position in one of the four direction.   That is, 
“E” moves a robot one slot East (to the right) so if the robot was on position (3, 4), it would now 
be on (4, 4).  The command N would move the robot one position north so a robot at position 
(4, 4) would be at (4, 5).
